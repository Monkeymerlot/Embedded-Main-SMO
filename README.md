# MAUI Engine
The **MA**in **UI** for the Albro UI Framework. Uses Embedded SMOs as subpanels, allowing for a fast generation of extensible, modern, and modular UIs. Simply create a MAUI Based SMO using JKI's SMO Editor and then add Embedded Subpanels in the "Subpanels" subdirectory of the MAUI Based UI you just created. Once everything is saved, go ahead and run the MAUI based Main UI using its "Test Launcher", et voila, you should have a working user interface.
